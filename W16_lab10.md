* Issue #18 (~400 points) : Refactor the code to follow a model, view, controller design pattern, which means factor out the game mechanic logic from the GUI and user input. This would make it easier to change the GUI and game mechanics without breaking the game while doing so, and would allow for future improvements such as allowing beyond two players to a game. This could be done in the following way :
       *Model : would contain all of the instance variables and mechanics of the game. For example it would know whose turn it is, what players are playing, what step it is, etc. and would be able to change these to advance the game i.e. next turn, next step, collect pot, etc. The model would not have to know anything about the view or the controller.
       *View : would take the information from the model, without changing anything, and display it to the GUI. Would not have to know anything about the controller.
       *Controller : would know information about both the model and the view. It would take information from user input from the view (i.e. button clicks) and tell the model to update itself accordingly.

* Issue #19 (~200 points) : There are a few bugfixes and improvements that can be made on the game in its current state :
  * The multiplayer clients and server do not disconnect and close upon exit of the game. Make it so they will exit gracefully, and/or take the user back to the main menu.
  * The multiplayer version of the game does not handle the case where a player reaches 0 chips. (Check the single player version of the game for how this should be handled.)
  * The chat client does not keep track of player IDs. Possibly allow the player create a nickname to be displayed when they talk in chat.

* Issue #20 (~300?? points) :  Current hand comparison in Hand.java does not determine the winner via "best of five", which results in some corner case hands winning when they should not. In the best of five format, which is traditional texas hold'em, only the best 5 cards should play. In the current implementation the best 7 cards play when comparing hands. For example the following situation has the incorrect winner :

Player 1 hand : 7, 7
Shared cards : 5, 5, 5, 5 K
Player 2 hand : 8 ,8
Winner: Player 2 //incorrect, it should be a split pot "tie", as both players best five cards are in the shared pool : 5, 5, 5, 5, K



* Improvements for the future : Beyond this, a good improvement on the socket connection aspect of the game would be to allow more than two players, say 4 or 5 to be able to connect to the server. Have the server start the game when everyone is ready, and simulate a real game of poker. This would involve big changes to the current code, including changing how change turn works, how fold works, how the GUI is setup, how the server works, etc. It may be best to refactor the code to follow a model view controller pattern first, as this would make things easier to implement. Also, the game would need to be abstracted beyond just two players, as it is hard coded to handle two players at the moment.
