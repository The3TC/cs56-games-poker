Project: Texas Hold'em Poker Game

(a) This project is a GUI application that plays a simple game of Texas Hold'em Poker between the
    user and the computer without any bets or actions from the player.

(b) User stories:
    -As a player, I can allow the turn card to be dealt, and furthermore the river to be dealt,
    so that the game can advance according to the rules.
    -As a player, I can view the two cards I've been dealt, as well as the cards in the shared hand,
    so that I may judge how good my hand is and decide what I want to do as the game continues.
    -As a player, I can continue playing multiple hands by pressing "replay" so that I may enjoy
    playing poker as it often is played in the real world, over multiple hands.

(c) The software does run. Currently, the game operates by dealing two cards to the player and the
    dealer (computer), advances through the dealing of the shared hand at the prompting of the user,
    and compares hands at the end, declaring a winner.

(d) Possible additional user stories:
    -As a player, I can place/match bets, raise, all in, or fold so that I can gamble my money
    in smart ways and try to win as much as possible.
    -As a player, I can view how much money I have, how much money my opponent has, and how much
    money is in the pot at any given time, so that I can make educated decisions about my bets.
    -As a player, I can visible see my opponents actions (call, check, fold, etc.) so that I
    can respond appropriately.
    -As a player, I can view the results of the showdown (the two best hands for each player as
    calculated by the program) so that I can understand how the winner is decided and learn more
    about how the game is played.

(e) The README.md looks fine, but maybe include the fact that the game as it is does not include the
    ability to bet money or fold hands.

(f) The build.xml is in good condition. It only includes important targets and has descriptions on
    all targets.

(g) There are a few small issues with the program, and a lot of improvements that can be added
    it. Smaller issues include condensing blocks of handwritten code like in the constructor for
    Deck and managing the placement of the window on replay. Large improvements could be made
    to the code by adding the functionality of betting and AI for the dealer. Making such improvements
    would definitely be worth 1000 points in our opinion.

(h) TODO: maybe do this part

(i) The code is fairly easy to understand at a glance, although some of the functions do get very
    lengthy and hard to read e.g. sameHand() in Hand.java. The classes and their purposes
    are pretty straightforward and intuitive. The Card class is used to represent a card, with it's
    suit and number. The Hand class extends ArrayList, specifically ArrayList<Card>, and provides
    methods to calculate it's value as it would have in poker and compare it to other hands. Deck
    represents a standard deck of 52 Cards, and provides methods to deal Cards, draw Cards, and
    discard Cards from the deck in order to simulate the random effect of shuffling and dealing cards
    from a real deck of cards. The PokerGame class is the class that is actually run to play the
    game, and contains all of the swing GUI components as well as handles the flow of the game. As it
    is, the game shows cards with their images as .png files and the game progresses by the user
    pressing a button to have the next card(s) dealt.

(j) Yes there is testing, but maybe not complete
    TODO : finish this part
