Project: Texas Hold'em Poker Game

(a) This project is a GUI application that plays a simple game of Texas Hold'em Poker between the
    user and the computer.

(b) User stories:
    -As a player, I can allow the turn card to be dealt, and furthermore the river to be dealt,
    so that the game can advance according to the rules.
    -As a player, I can view the two cards I've been dealt, as well as the cards in the shared hand,
    so that I may judge how good my hand is and decide what I want to do as the game continues.
    -As a player, I can continue playing multiple hands by pressing "replay" so that I may enjoy
    playing poker as it often is played in the real world, over multiple hands.
    -As a player, I can place/match bets, raise, all in, or fold so that I can gamble my money
    in smart ways and try to win as much as possible.
    -As a player, I can view how much money I have, how much money my opponent has, and how much
    money is in the pot at any given time, so that I can make educated decisions about my bets.
    -As a player, I can visible see my opponents actions (call, check, fold, etc.) so that I
    can respond appropriately.
    -As a player, I can view the results of the showdown (the two best hands for each player as
    calculated by the program) so that I can understand how the winner is decided and learn more
    about how the game is played.

(c) The software does run. Currently, the game operates by dealing two cards to the player and the
    dealer (computer). The user can bet, fold, or check before each round at any time. The rest of
    the cards are dealt. If the hand is taken all the way to the end, the winner is decided by
    the best hand.

(d) Possible additional user stories:
    -As two players, we can play against eachother on a local socket connection so that we can
    play multiplayer poker.
    -As a player, I can 

(e) The README.md looks fine.

(f) The build.xml is in good condition. It only includes important targets and has descriptions on
    all targets.

(g) There are a few small issues with the program, and a lot of improvements that can be added
    it. Smaller issues include condensing blocks of handwritten code like in the constructor for
    Deck, managing the placement of the window on replay, and getting rid of unnecessary comments.
    Large improvements could be madeto the code by adding the functionality of betting and AI for the
    dealer. Making such improvements would definitely be worth 1000 points in our opinion.

(i) The code is fairly easy to understand at a glance, although some of the functions do get very
    lengthy and hard to read e.g. sameHand() in Hand.java. The classes and their purposes
    are pretty straightforward and intuitive. The Card class is used to represent a card, with it's
    suit and number. The Hand class extends ArrayList, specifically ArrayList<Card>, and provides
    methods to calculate it's value as it would have in poker and compare it to other hands. Deck
    represents a standard deck of 52 Cards, and provides methods to deal Cards, draw Cards, and
    discard Cards from the deck in order to simulate the random effect of shuffling and dealing cards
    from a real deck of cards. The PokerGame class is the class that is actually run to play the
    game, and contains all of the swing GUI components as well as handles the flow of the game. As it
    is, the game shows cards with their images as .png files and the game progresses by the user
    pressing a button to have the next card(s) dealt.

(j) Yes there is testing, but maybe not complete. There are a number of hard-coded tests for
    comparing hands, but there could be some edge cases that are being overlooked. Full coverage
    testing would be optimal.
