###Description:

This project is a Texas Holdem emulator. The objective of the card game is to get the best hand and to win all of the opponents' chips.

###User Stories:

As a user, I have the option of selecting single player mode in the menu so that I can play a game against a computer. 
On a user's turn, you have the chance to bet chips, check, or fold.
Users can create or connect to a chat server so that they can talk to other users around the network.

###Assessment of project:

* The chat server does not work as intended. It does run, but only those who join an already created server can chat.
* Single player mode runs. The game can be played to completion.

###User Stories: Potential stores

* As a user, I can be an active member of a chatroom even if I'm the one that created the chatroom.
* As a user, I can join a multiplayer server so that I can play with multiple other players.
* As a user, I can play a game against a computer that doesn't fold immediately if I bet crazy high.

###Assessment of the README

The READEME file looks to be relatively comprehensive. One area in which it could improve is how the AI works.

###Assessment of the Build.xml file

The Build.xml file has relatively little descriptions. The environment and test descriptions are in need of more in depth decriptions in particular.

###Issues

There is more than enough issues to achieve 1000 points on the project. They are clear in terms of what the expectations are as well.
